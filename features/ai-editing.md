# AI-Powered Editing

Scratch brings AI capabilities to your entire content library, letting you make bulk edits while staying in control.

## How it works

1. **Load your content** - Connect to your data source and create a workbook
2. **Give AI instructions** - Describe what you want to change in natural language
3. **Review suggestions** - See exactly what the AI proposes to change
4. **Accept or reject** - Keep what works, discard what doesn't

## Editing modes

### Library View
See all your content in a table. Ask the AI to:
- Categorize or tag multiple records
- Generate summaries for all items
- Find and fix inconsistencies across your library
- Add or update fields in bulk

### Single-Record View
Focus on one piece of content for detailed editing:
- Deep rewrites and improvements
- Long-form content editing
- Detailed formatting changes

## Precision tools

### Find and Replace
Make targeted substitutions across your content without involving the AI.

### Append
Add content to the end of any field.

### Insert with @@
Mark exact spots in your content with `@@` where you want new content inserted.

## Tips for effective prompts

- Be specific about what you want changed
- Reference your style guide or brand voice
- Tell the AI which fields to focus on
- Use filters to narrow down which records to edit
