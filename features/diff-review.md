# Diff Review & Publishing

Scratch shows you exactly what changes before anything goes live. Review AI suggestions at a glance and publish with confidence.

## Reviewing changes

### Inline diff view
See exactly what ~~was removed~~ and **what was added** right in the document. Perfect for quick reviews of small changes.

### Side-by-side view
Compare the original and edited versions side by side. Great for reviewing substantial rewrites.

## Accepting and rejecting

You have full control over every change:

- **Accept a single cell** - Approve one specific edit
- **Reject a single cell** - Discard one specific edit
- **Accept entire record** - Approve all changes to one item
- **Accept all** - Approve all suggested changes in your workbook

## Publishing

Once you've accepted the changes you want:

1. Click **Publish**
2. Preview exactly what will change at the source
3. Confirm to push changes live
